Review
"Fits comfortable in my hand, love all the buttons that you can set controls to, my only ""complaint"" is the location of the dpi/sensitivity adjuster buttons on the mouse as they are super close to the left click and I find myself fat-fingering the buttons causing me to miss shots sometimes because I bump up my sensitivity by accident but I'm sure not everyone is gonna have that problem it's just what happened to me when I first got this mouse so keep that in mind but I quickly got used to it and am more careful about my finger placement. Other then that, great mouse for the price and I was lucky enough to catch it on sale :)"
"I've been using the Logitech G502 HERO High-Performance Wired Gaming Mouse for years now, and it's hands down the best mouse I've ever owned. So much so that I buy a new one every two or three yearsâ€”not because the old one breaks, but because I like to rotate them between my three computers. The newest always goes to my primary setup, and the older ones keep performing flawlessly on the secondary machines.

What sets this mouse apart is the level of customization it offers. The adjustable weight system is a standout feature for me. Being able to fine-tune the weight to match my preference makes a huge difference during long gaming sessions or extended work hours. It feels tailor-made for my hand every time.

The programmable macros are another highlight. Assigning custom commands to the buttons has streamlined both my gaming and productivity workflows. Whether I'm diving into intense gaming battles or managing complex software tasks, having those macros at my fingertips is incredibly convenient.

The build quality is exceptional. Even after years of heavy use, my older G502 mice are still going strong without any signs of wear or performance issues. The ergonomic design fits comfortably in my hand, and the responsiveness is top-notch.

If you're in the market for a reliable, customizable, and high-performing mouse, I can't recommend the Logitech G502 HERO enough. It's been a consistent and invaluable part of my setup for years, and I don't see that changing anytime soon."
"There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!

1) Daily use
Not everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros:
- Fits incredibly well around your hand
- Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use
> Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc.
- Great grip
- Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software

2) Gaming
When I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros:
- You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better!
- The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something)
- The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.

Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!

*** Update ***
The mouse is durable and has stood the test of time very well! The software setting up the mouse bindings has changed, so I am still getting used to that. Works very well in gaming, and enjoy the ability to transition from work 1,000 dpi and copy/paste, cut, etc., as bindings to gaming with 650 dpi jump, melee, etc.. Definitely good fit for someone with a big palm like myself."
"The G502 lives up to the hype! The HERO sensor is incredibly accurate and responsive, even at the absurdly high 16,000 DPI (though I rarely use it that high). The customizable buttons are incredibly useful, allowing me to streamline actions in games and even automate repetitive tasks at work. I can now copy and paste with just two button presses, a massive time-saver. The adjustable weights let me fine-tune the feel in my hand. This is a premium mouse that's built to last, and I highly recommend it to any serious gamer or anyone who wants to increase their productivity."
"For the last 2 years, I used a HyperX Pulsefire Raid. You can read my review on it, but the mouse wheel failed only after 2 years, prompting me to switch brands back to Logitech as I need a mouse with more buttons than the typical FPS gaming mouse.

I have an older G502 Proteus Core ('the Core'), which I used as a back until the G502 Hero came. They are pretty much the same shape design. Only a couple of differences with the hardware. First, the Hero as a way better cable than the Core. This is hands down. However, the Core's mouse wheel is better despite looking exactly the same. I never had an issue with scrolling with the Core for the handful of years I used it, but the Hero's mouse wheel is for a lack of better work, 'slippery'. I have/had (more on that later) getting finger grip on it to turn it effortlessly. I never remember having an issue with Core and from my side by side, the Core is easier because the detents are less pronounced.

I have larger than average hands and I will say I miss the general form factor of the Pulsefire Raid a lot. It was very comfortable for me to hold. Going back to the G502 design, my hand feels 'crampy' holding it too long as my fingers just don't lay on it the same way. Side by side, the Pulsefire Raid only looks ever so slightly wider, but the design is a little more square and my hand lays on it just right.

In terms of tracking, the Hero feels way better than the Core and the Pulsefire Raid. Interestingly, the Pulsefire Raid actually glides smoother in my opinion, but I think Hero has slightly more friction, but that is actually helpful to me. I did an aim reflex test in a aim practice app and I actually did better with the Hero than the Pulsefire Raid (after using this mouse for 2 years). I think a combination of a better sensor and the slightly more friction (ie; stopping speed) made the Hero better for me.

Regarding the mouse wheel on the Hero, I decided to take a risk and try something to improve the grip on the wheel. The risk was basically the $40 because I would not be able to consciously and fairly return it after my 'mod'. Ultimately, I ended up using a Dremel tool with pretty course sand paper attachment. This was not a disk, but a barrel form factor so it spun 100% horizontal over the notches. I lightly swiped (not a press or a tap, your are not sanding, just a slight pass over once or twice to create 'texture') over each knob while holding the mouse upside down to prevent any shavings going into the mouse. Note and very important, if you were to attempt this, wear safety glasses. I always wear them when working with any tools and I did feel some particles hit my face doing this. You really do not want these metal shavings in your eyes. Overall, this really did the trick for me and the mouse wheel is way better. I attached a picture to see generally what if looks like now, but this change makes the mouse a keeper for me. I was considering finding another mouse because the mouse wheel for me was not good.

So overall for me and my uses and having to mod the mouse wheel, which took all of 5 minutes only, I am rating this mouse a 4. The mouse is too small for my hand, but I will need to adjust and the mouse wheel is surprisingly bad out of the box, but it performs well and my aim tests showed the potential it has for me."
"I had originally purchased the logitech G502 X wired mouse as it's supposed to be an updated version of the G502 HERO. I was not impressed with G502 X. All the supposed upgrades from the G502 HERO were a let down. The G502 HERO is much better in every way. The side buttons are positioned correctly. The additional 2 top buttons on the left main button are minimal and well placed. I prefer a solid mouse with some heft to it, out of the box the build quality feels great and the additional weights are nice to have.

In comparison the G502 X felt cheap, and was too light for my tastes. The side buttons were moved too far back making it awkward to hit the back button. The size of the 2 additional top buttons on the main left button were increased, which made it very easy to accidentally press them while gaming.

If you are comparing the two mice I hope this helps. There is a reason why the G502 HERO has as many reviews as it does."
"I like the shape/ ergonomics of this mouse, but it's not perfect. After migrating from Razer Deathadder Elite, my main problem with this mouse is the sharp corners around the back and forward thumb buttons on the side, they just cut right into the thumb in less then comfortable manner. If Logitech could take a page from Razer and make it a smooth back bottom, this would be a perfect mouse.

What I do like is lots of programmable buttons, for plenty of macro possibilities. Having an extra thumb button is one of my favorite features. The scroll wheel is among the best of all the mice I have tried from Steelcase, ASUS, Razer. The side scroll works a lot better then I imagined.

Sad to say a lot of companies are cutting corners today, Razer in particular, their latest mice feel disappointingly cheap, with very low quality scroll wheel which frequently break. But this does feel like a premium product, worth the investment."
So comfortable! Easy to use. Works amazingly. Top tier quality and it even has weights so that your mouse can't fling easily. Scrolling has two different settings which makes it even better. USB connects and works wonderfully.
"Hello,

I own several Logitech devices. They are:

Gamepad/Controller: F710 and F310
Camera: C910
Headset: G933
Keyboard: G105
Mouse: G502 Hero

The Logitech G Hub software I use for the Keyboard and Headset is 8.82.151. The camera has its own and I have to run an old version of Logitech Gaming Software (5.10) for the F710 and F310.

I open the package for the G502 Hero mouse and find:

1) The mouse
2) A small sheet of page with four diagrams on it. They are:
2A) A drawing of an USB plug going into a computer.
2B) A computer with a URL: logitechG.com/support/G502-HERO
2C) Two hands holding an opened mouse. (No drawing or words to tell you how to open the mouse.)
2D) Something being inserted into the SIDE of the mouse.
3) A black 6 sided box.

When I go to the URL, I'm taken to the default Logitech support page for ALL Products. From the URL, I thought it would take me to the support page for the G502-HERO (but it doesn't - why?).

I decided to contact Logitech support. First I try chat, but because I can't find the serial number I'm asked for the product model. When I tell it I have a mouse up comes a list for all the mice. Unfortunately, the G502-HERO is not on the list. The ""Logitech Assistant"" simply keeps asking me about my product. I tell it is a mouse. It gives me a list that doesn't include the G502-HERO. This never ends. It won't let me talk to an agent until I. Well, I'm not sure how to fix the Logitech Assistant. (Why could I type in G502-HERO and it would recognize it. I tried typing in G502-HERO but the assistant ignored me.)

In the end, I decide to call Logitech. The phone system works great and in under a minute I'm talking to a real life person. She want to help me. Outstanding! She listens to all the issues about the packaging, the URL, etc. Quickly, she send, to my email containing four links:

1) The G502-HERO manual. I've yet to read it.
2) The G-Hub manual.
3) The G502-HERO downloads.
4) The G502-HERO FAQ list.

I start the version of G-Hub I am using for the keyboard and headset. It doesn't recognize the mouse.

She asks me to download the latest version of G-Hub. I'm on version 8.82.151.

I comply downloading and then starting the installation process. It wants to restart the system. OK, I restart the computer. After logging back into Windows, nothing happens. The G Hub software is still at 8.82.151. Ah! Why did I have to restart? What was the purpose of the restart. Nothing looks different, so why the restart?

The Logitech support person says to start the installer again. It stops IMMEDIATELY saying there is an older version on the system and can't continue. WHAT THE F*******?

Honestly:
** Why couldn't the installer say this before having me do a restart?
** Why can't the new installer uninstall the old version and MIGRATE my existing configurations?

It is at this point she says the new version (9 something) might not destroy my existing configurations. Why? She thinks the manual uninstall of 8.82.151 will erase/destroy my existing configuration OR maybe the new version will do it. This would means I would not be able to use my keyboard, headset, or game controller. She is pretty sure the camera will continue to work.

She offers to open a ticket for those above her and I should hear back in 3 day to a week either via email or a phone call.

She can't even tell me if the new G-Hub supports my existing devices. I might have to replace all my Logitech devices with new hardware (forced obsolescence), it seems to me.

Thing is the F710 and F310 are the only game controller Logitech is selling. (I use the controller for several games, including Final Fantasy XI and Alpha Prison (on Steam).) I use the headset with Discord, games, etc. I have configured the keyboard for lots of various stuff. Why shouldn't Logitech provide a migration path for people with older Logitech gear?

I don't have an end to this story / issue / review, yet. All I know is this mouse - right now - doesn't do anything more than a simple ball mouse. I can't enable the higher DPI support or any button. Finally, I still don't understand drawings 3 and 4 or know what I'm suppose to do with the 6 sided thing.

Bottom line: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

***> The printed documentation doesn't make sense and doesn't have an URL for the product (you just go to the default support page for all products).
***> There seems to be serious lack of support for your past purchases with Logitech's G-Hub.
***> Why can't Logitech developers uninstall past versions and insure you don't lose your existing configuration?

I will update this review should Logitech get back to me. I'll gladly let you know how it goes.

UPDATE 1: I have yet to hear back from Logitech support on my software issues. The mouse is running in default mode. I have seen two hardware issues.

1) I changed out my Logitech G105 keyboard for a Dell KB522, which has an internal 2 port USB 2.0 hub. I booted my Dell T7910 and went into the BIOS (where my Razer mouse failed), but this Logitech mouse worked great! It moved and the G was lit.

The problems with the Logitech mouse started after the system booted to Windows 10 and presented the login screen. The G on the mouse never lit and the cursor never appeared on the screen. Only after I plugged in my Dell Optical mouse (with the tracking problem) did the cursor appear on the Windows login screen.

I did get the mouse to appear by plugging it into my Amazon Basic 7 port USB 2.0 hub. Maybe it is a power issue, but Logitech doesn't say the mouse has unusual power requirements.

2) The wheel is overly sensitive for scrolling on webpages and other programs. I'm hoping I can adjust this through the software (whenever Logitech can get back to me with a solution).

Again the bottom line hasn't changed: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

Final update: Logitech got back to me with all the answers on day 35! I thought about returning it to Amazon on day 30, but realized I couldn't get to UPS before the UPS store closed.

Logitech got the mouse working but the G105 keyboard stopped working. Several days later and I'm told the new GHub no longer supports the G105. The answer is yet another piece of software to run.

Why can't Logitech create a single interface for all their software / products (old and current)? Aren't customers returning worth it?"
"Great mouse, awesome customization from color to DPI settings. I love being able to set 3 DPI settings up for those times when I'm gaming and need to really whip around. I have 2 of them, one for work and one for home. In the office it's a bit overkill but when you get used to the feel and response of this mouse, others feel inadequate. The scroll wheel is another big plus, looking at a long document or list, just press the free wheel button, give it a flick, and watch it scroll to the end for you. Button position is only an issue when you slam it into your keyboard and change your DPI mid fight. You will get good and changing it back or learn to move your stuff out of the way very quickly."
"Fits comfortable in my hand, love all the buttons that you can set controls to, my only ""complaint"" is the location of the dpi/sensitivity adjuster buttons on the mouse as they are super close to the left click and I find myself fat-fingering the buttons causing me to miss shots sometimes because I bump up my sensitivity by accident but I'm sure not everyone is gonna have that problem it's just what happened to me when I first got this mouse so keep that in mind but I quickly got used to it and am more careful about my finger placement.

The Logitech G Hub software I use for the Keyboard and Headset is 8.82.151. The camera has its own and I have to run an old version of Logitech Gaming Software (5.10) for the F710 and F310.

I open the package for the G502 Hero mouse and find:

Unfortunately, the G502-HERO is not on the list. The ""Logitech Assistant"" simply keeps asking me about my product. I tell it is a mouse. It gives me a list that doesn't include the G502-HERO. This never ends. It won't let me talk to an agent until I. Well, I'm not sure how to fix the Logitech Assistant. (Why could I type in G502-HERO and it would recognize it. I tried typing in G502-HERO but the assistant ignored me.)

In the end, I decide to call Logitech. The phone system works great and in under a minute I'm talking to a real life person. She want to help me. Outstanding! She listens to all the issues about the packaging, the URL, etc. Quickly, she send, to my email containing four links:

1) The G502-HERO manual. I've yet to read it.
2) The G-Hub manual.
3) The G502-HERO downloads.
4) The G502-HERO FAQ list.

I start the version of G-Hub I am using for the keyboard and headset. It doesn't recognize the mouse.

She asks me to download the latest version of G-Hub. I'm on version 8.82.151.

I comply downloading and then starting the installation process. It wants to restart the system. OK, I restart the computer. After logging back into Windows, nothing happens. The G Hub software is still at 8.82.151. Ah! Why did I have to restart? What was the purpose of the restart. Nothing looks different, so why the restart?

The Logitech support person says to start the installer again. It stops IMMEDIATELY saying there is an older version on the system and can't continue. WHAT THE F*******?

Honestly:
** Why couldn't the installer say this before having me do a restart?
** Why can't the new installer uninstall the old version and MIGRATE my existing configurations?

It is at this point she says the new version (9 something) might not destroy my existing configurations. Why? She thinks the manual uninstall of 8.82.151 will erase/destroy my existing configuration OR maybe the new version will do it. This would means I would not be able to use my keyboard, headset, or game controller. She is pretty sure the camera will continue to work.

She offers to open a ticket for those above her and I should hear back in 3 day to a week either via email or a phone call.

She can't even tell me if the new G-Hub supports my existing devices. I might have to replace all my Logitech devices with new hardware (forced obsolescence), it seems to me.

Thing is the F710 and F310 are the only game controller Logitech is selling. (I use the controller for several games, including Final Fantasy XI and Alpha Prison (on Steam).) I use the headset with Discord, games, etc. I have configured the keyboard for lots of various stuff. Why shouldn't Logitech provide a migration path for people with older Logitech gear?

I don't have an end to this story / issue / review, yet. All I know is this mouse - right now - doesn't do anything more than a simple ball mouse. I can't enable the higher DPI support or any button. Finally, I still don't understand drawings 3 and 4 or know what I'm suppose to do with the 6 sided thing.

Bottom line: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

***> The printed documentation doesn't make sense and doesn't have an URL for the product (you just go to the default support page for all products).
***> There seems to be serious lack of support for your past purchases with Logitech's G-Hub.
***> Why can't Logitech developers uninstall past versions and insure you don't lose your existing configuration?

I will update this review should Logitech get back to me. I'll gladly let you know how it goes.

UPDATE 1: I have yet to hear back from Logitech support on my software issues. The mouse is running in default mode. I have seen two hardware issues.

1) I changed out my Logitech G105 keyboard for a Dell KB522, which has an internal 2 port USB 2.0 hub. I booted my Dell T7910 and went into the BIOS (where my Razer mouse failed), but this Logitech mouse worked great! It moved and the G was lit.

The problems with the Logitech mouse started after the system booted to Windows 10 and presented the login screen. The G on the mouse never lit and the cursor never appeared on the screen. Only after I plugged in my Dell Optical mouse (with the tracking problem) did the cursor appear on the Windows login screen.

I did get the mouse to appear by plugging it into my Amazon Basic 7 port USB 2.0 hub. Maybe it is a power issue, but Logitech doesn't say the mouse has unusual power requirements.

2) The wheel is overly sensitive for scrolling on webpages and other programs. I'm hoping I can adjust this through the software (whenever Logitech can get back to me with a solution).

Again the bottom line hasn't changed: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

Final update: Logitech got back to me with all the answers on day 35! I thought about returning it to Amazon on day 30, but realized I couldn't get to UPS before the UPS store closed.

Logitech got the mouse working but the G105 keyboard stopped working. Several days later and I'm told the new GHub no longer supports the G105. The answer is yet another piece of software to run.

Why can't Logitech create a single interface for all their software / products (old and current)? Aren't customers returning worth it?"
"Great mouse, awesome customization from color to DPI settings. I love being able to set 3 DPI settings up for those times when I'm gaming and need to really whip around. I have 2 of them, one for work and one for home. In the office it's a bit overkill but when you get used to the feel and response of this mouse, others feel inadequate. The scroll wheel is another big plus, looking at a long document or list, just press the free wheel button, give it a flick, and watch it scroll to the end for you. Button position is only an issue when you slam it into your keyboard and change your DPI mid fight. You will get good and changing it back or learn to move your stuff out of the way very quickly."
"Fits comfortable in my hand, love all the buttons that you can set controls to, my only ""complaint"" is the location of the dpi/sensitivity adjuster buttons on the mouse as they are super close to the left click and I find myself fat-fingering the buttons causing me to miss shots sometimes because I bump up my sensitivity by accident but I'm sure not everyone is gonna have that problem it's just what happened to me when I first got this mouse so keep that in mind but I quickly got used to it and am more careful about my finger placement. Other then that, great mouse for the price and I was lucky enough to catch it on sale :)"
"I've been using the Logitech G502 HERO High-Performance Wired Gaming Mouse for years now, and it's hands down the best mouse I've ever owned. So much so that I buy a new one every two or three yearsâ€”not because the old one breaks, but because I like to rotate them between my three computers. The newest always goes to my primary setup, and the older ones keep performing flawlessly on the secondary machines.

What sets this mouse apart is the level of customization it offers. The adjustable weight system is a standout feature for me. Being able to fine-tune the weight to match my preference makes a huge difference during long gaming sessions or extended work hours. It feels tailor-made for my hand every time.

The programmable macros are another highlight. Assigning custom commands to the buttons has streamlined both my gaming and productivity workflows. Whether I'm diving into intense gaming battles or managing complex software tasks, having those macros at my fingertips is incredibly convenient.

The build quality is exceptional. Even after years of heavy use, my older G502 mice are still going strong without any signs of wear or performance issues. The ergonomic design fits comfortably in my hand, and the responsiveness is top-notch.

If you're in the market for a reliable, customizable, and high-performing mouse, I can't recommend the Logitech G502 HERO enough. It's been a consistent and invaluable part of my setup for years, and I don't see that changing anytime soon."
"There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!

1) Daily use
Not everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros:
- Fits incredibly well around your hand
- Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use
> Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc.
- Great grip
- Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software

2) Gaming
When I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros:
- You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better!
- The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something)
- The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.

Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!

*** Update ***
The mouse is durable and has stood the test of time very well! The software setting up the mouse bindings has changed, so I am still getting used to that. Works very well in gaming, and enjoy the ability to transition from work 1,000 dpi and copy/paste, cut, etc., as bindings to gaming with 650 dpi jump, melee, etc.. Definitely good fit for someone with a big palm like myself."
"The G502 lives up to the hype! The HERO sensor is incredibly accurate and responsive, even at the absurdly high 16,000 DPI (though I rarely use it that high). The customizable buttons are incredibly useful, allowing me to streamline actions in games and even automate repetitive tasks at work. I can now copy and paste with just two button presses, a massive time-saver. The adjustable weights let me fine-tune the feel in my hand. This is a premium mouse that's built to last, and I highly recommend it to any serious gamer or anyone who wants to increase their productivity."
"For the last 2 years, I used a HyperX Pulsefire Raid. You can read my review on it, but the mouse wheel failed only after 2 years, prompting me to switch brands back to Logitech as I need a mouse with more buttons than the typical FPS gaming mouse.

I have an older G502 Proteus Core ('the Core'), which I used as a back until the G502 Hero came. They are pretty much the same shape design. Only a couple of differences with the hardware. First, the Hero as a way better cable than the Core. This is hands down. However, the Core's mouse wheel is better despite looking exactly the same. I never had an issue with scrolling with the Core for the handful of years I used it, but the Hero's mouse wheel is for a lack of better work, 'slippery'. I have/had (more on that later) getting finger grip on it to turn it effortlessly. I never remember having an issue with Core and from my side by side, the Core is easier because the detents are less pronounced.

I have larger than average hands and I will say I miss the general form factor of the Pulsefire Raid a lot. It was very comfortable for me to hold. Going back to the G502 design, my hand feels 'crampy' holding it too long as my fingers just don't lay on it the same way. Side by side, the Pulsefire Raid only looks ever so slightly wider, but the design is a little more square and my hand lays on it just right.

In terms of tracking, the Hero feels way better than the Core and the Pulsefire Raid. Interestingly, the Pulsefire Raid actually glides smoother in my opinion, but I think Hero has slightly more friction, but that is actually helpful to me. I did an aim reflex test in a aim practice app and I actually did better with the Hero than the Pulsefire Raid (after using this mouse for 2 years). I think a combination of a better sensor and the slightly more friction (ie; stopping speed) made the Hero better for me.

Regarding the mouse wheel on the Hero, I decided to take a risk and try something to improve the grip on the wheel. The risk was basically the $40 because I would not be able to consciously and fairly return it after my 'mod'. Ultimately, I ended up using a Dremel tool with pretty course sand paper attachment. This was not a disk, but a barrel form factor so it spun 100% horizontal over the notches. I lightly swiped (not a press or a tap, your are not sanding, just a slight pass over once or twice to create 'texture') over each knob while holding the mouse upside down to prevent any shavings going into the mouse. Note and very important, if you were to attempt this, wear safety glasses. I always wear them when working with any tools and I did feel some particles hit my face doing this. You really do not want these metal shavings in your eyes. Overall, this really did the trick for me and the mouse wheel is way better. I attached a picture to see generally what if looks like now, but this change makes the mouse a keeper for me. I was considering finding another mouse because the mouse wheel for me was not good.

So overall for me and my uses and having to mod the mouse wheel, which took all of 5 minutes only, I am rating this mouse a 4. The mouse is too small for my hand, but I will need to adjust and the mouse wheel is surprisingly bad out of the box, but it performs well and my aim tests showed the potential it has for me."
"I had originally purchased the logitech G502 X wired mouse as it's supposed to be an updated version of the G502 HERO. I was not impressed with G502 X. All the supposed upgrades from the G502 HERO were a let down. The G502 HERO is much better in every way. The side buttons are positioned correctly. The additional 2 top buttons on the left main button are minimal and well placed. I prefer a solid mouse with some heft to it, out of the box the build quality feels great and the additional weights are nice to have.

In comparison the G502 X felt cheap, and was too light for my tastes. The side buttons were moved too far back making it awkward to hit the back button. The size of the 2 additional top buttons on the main left button were increased, which made it very easy to accidentally press them while gaming.

If you are comparing the two mice I hope this helps. There is a reason why the G502 HERO has as many reviews as it does."
"I like the shape/ ergonomics of this mouse, but it's not perfect. After migrating from Razer Deathadder Elite, my main problem with this mouse is the sharp corners around the back and forward thumb buttons on the side, they just cut right into the thumb in less then comfortable manner. If Logitech could take a page from Razer and make it a smooth back bottom, this would be a perfect mouse.

What I do like is lots of programmable buttons, for plenty of macro possibilities. Having an extra thumb button is one of my favorite features. The scroll wheel is among the best of all the mice I have tried from Steelcase, ASUS, Razer. The side scroll works a lot better then I imagined.

Sad to say a lot of companies are cutting corners today, Razer in particular, their latest mice feel disappointingly cheap, with very low quality scroll wheel which frequently break. But this does feel like a premium product, worth the investment."
So comfortable! Easy to use. Works amazingly. Top tier quality and it even has weights so that your mouse can't fling easily. Scrolling has two different settings which makes it even better. USB connects and works wonderfully.
"Hello,

I own several Logitech devices. They are:

Gamepad/Controller: F710 and F310
Camera: C910
Headset: G933
Keyboard: G105
Mouse: G502 Hero

The Logitech G Hub software I use for the Keyboard and Headset is 8.82.151. The camera has its own and I have to run an old version of Logitech Gaming Software (5.10) for the F710 and F310.

I open the package for the G502 Hero mouse and find:

1) The mouse
2) A small sheet of page with four diagrams on it. They are:
2A) A drawing of an USB plug going into a computer.
2B) A computer with a URL: logitechG.com/support/G502-HERO
2C) Two hands holding an opened mouse. (No drawing or words to tell you how to open the mouse.)
2D) Something being inserted into the SIDE of the mouse.
3) A black 6 sided box.

When I go to the URL, I'm taken to the default Logitech support page for ALL Products. From the URL, I thought it would take me to the support page for the G502-HERO (but it doesn't - why?).

I have an older G502 Proteus Core ('the Core'), which I used as a back until the G502 Hero came. They are pretty much the same shape design. Only a couple of differences with the hardware. First, the Hero as a way better cable than the Core. This is hands down. However, the Core's mouse wheel is better despite looking exactly the same. I never had an issue with scrolling with the Core for the handful of years I used it, but the Hero's mouse wheel is for a lack of better work, 'slippery'. I have/had (more on that later) getting finger grip on it to turn it effortlessly. I never remember having an issue with Core and from my side by side, the Core is easier because the detents are less pronounced.

I have larger than average hands and I will say I miss the general form factor of the Pulsefire Raid a lot. It was very comfortable for me to hold. Going back to the G502 design, my hand feels 'crampy' holding it too long as my fingers just don't lay on it the same way. Side by side, the Pulsefire Raid only looks ever so slightly wider, but the design is a little more square and my hand lays on it just right.

In terms of tracking, the Hero feels way better than the Core and the Pulsefire Raid. Interestingly, the Pulsefire Raid actually glides smoother in my opinion, but I think Hero has slightly more friction, but that is actually helpful to me. I did an aim reflex test in a aim practice app and I actually did better with the Hero than the Pulsefire Raid (after using this mouse for 2 years). I think a combination of a better sensor and the slightly more friction (ie; stopping speed) made the Hero better for me.

Regarding the mouse wheel on the Hero, I decided to take a risk and try something to improve the grip on the wheel. The risk was basically the $40 because I would not be able to consciously and fairly return it after my 'mod'. Ultimately, I ended up using a Dremel tool with pretty course sand paper attachment. This was not a disk, but a barrel form factor so it spun 100% horizontal over the notches. I lightly swiped (not a press or a tap, your are not sanding, just a slight pass over once or twice to create 'texture') over each knob while holding the mouse upside down to prevent any shavings going into the mouse. Note and very important, if you were to attempt this, wear safety glasses. I always wear them when working with any tools and I did feel some particles hit my face doing this. You really do not want these metal shavings in your eyes. Overall, this really did the trick for me and the mouse wheel is way better. I attached a picture to see generally what if looks like now, but this change makes the mouse a keeper for me. I was considering finding another mouse because the mouse wheel for me was not good.

So overall for me and my uses and having to mod the mouse wheel, which took all of 5 minutes only, I am rating this mouse a 4. The mouse is too small for my hand, but I will need to adjust and the mouse wheel is surprisingly bad out of the box, but it performs well and my aim tests showed the potential it has for me."
"I had originally purchased the logitech G502 X wired mouse as it's supposed to be an updated version of the G502 HERO. I was not impressed with G502 X. All the supposed upgrades from the G502 HERO were a let down. The G502 HERO is much better in every way. The side buttons are positioned correctly. The additional 2 top buttons on the left main button are minimal and well placed. I prefer a solid mouse with some heft to it, out of the box the build quality feels great and the additional weights are nice to have.

In comparison the G502 X felt cheap, and was too light for my tastes. The side buttons were moved too far back making it awkward to hit the back button. The size of the 2 additional top buttons on the main left button were increased, which made it very easy to accidentally press them while gaming.

If you are comparing the two mice I hope this helps. There is a reason why the G502 HERO has as many reviews as it does."
"I like the shape/ ergonomics of this mouse, but it's not perfect. After migrating from Razer Deathadder Elite, my main problem with this mouse is the sharp corners around the back and forward thumb buttons on the side, they just cut right into the thumb in less then comfortable manner. If Logitech could take a page from Razer and make it a smooth back bottom, this would be a perfect mouse.

What I do like is lots of programmable buttons, for plenty of macro possibilities. Having an extra thumb button is one of my favorite features. The scroll wheel is among the best of all the mice I have tried from Steelcase, ASUS, Razer. The side scroll works a lot better then I imagined.

Sad to say a lot of companies are cutting corners today, Razer in particular, their latest mice feel disappointingly cheap, with very low quality scroll wheel which frequently break. But this does feel like a premium product, worth the investment."
So comfortable! Easy to use. Works amazingly. Top tier quality and it even has weights so that your mouse can't fling easily. Scrolling has two different settings which makes it even better. USB connects and works wonderfully.
"Hello,

I own several Logitech devices. They are:

Gamepad/Controller: F710 and F310
Camera: C910
Headset: G933
Keyboard: G105
Mouse: G502 Hero

The Logitech G Hub software I use for the Keyboard and Headset is 8.82.151. The camera has its own and I have to run an old version of Logitech Gaming Software (5.10) for the F710 and F310.

I open the package for the G502 Hero mouse and find:

1) The mouse
2) A small sheet of page with four diagrams on it. They are:
2A) A drawing of an USB plug going into a computer.
2B) A computer with a URL: logitechG.com/support/G502-HERO
2C) Two hands holding an opened mouse. (No drawing or words to tell you how to open the mouse.)
2D) Something being inserted into the SIDE of the mouse.
3) A black 6 sided box.

When I go to the URL, I'm taken to the default Logitech support page for ALL Products. From the URL, I thought it would take me to the support page for the G502-HERO (but it doesn't - why?).

I decided to contact Logitech support. First I try chat, but because I can't find the serial number I'm asked for the product model. When I tell it I have a mouse up comes a list for all the mice. Unfortunately, the G502-HERO is not on the list. The ""Logitech Assistant"" simply keeps asking me about my product. I tell it is a mouse. It gives me a list that doesn't include the G502-HERO. This never ends. It won't let me talk to an agent until I. Well, I'm not sure how to fix the Logitech Assistant. (Why could I type in G502-HERO and it would recognize it. I tried typing in G502-HERO but the assistant ignored me.)

In the end, I decide to call Logitech. The phone system works great and in under a minute I'm talking to a real life person. She want to help me. Outstanding! She listens to all the issues about the packaging, the URL, etc. Quickly, she send, to my email containing four links:

1) The G502-HERO manual. I've yet to read it.
2) The G-Hub manual.
3) The G502-HERO downloads.
4) The G502-HERO FAQ list.

I start the version of G-Hub I am using for the keyboard and headset. It doesn't recognize the mouse.

She asks me to download the latest version of G-Hub. I'm on version 8.82.151.

I comply downloading and then starting the installation process. It wants to restart the system. OK, I restart the computer. After logging back into Windows, nothing happens. The G Hub software is still at 8.82.151. Ah! Why did I have to restart? What was the purpose of the restart. Nothing looks different, so why the restart?

The Logitech support person says to start the installer again. It stops IMMEDIATELY saying there is an older version on the system and can't continue. WHAT THE F*******?

Honestly:
** Why couldn't the installer say this before having me do a restart?
** Why can't the new installer uninstall the old version and MIGRATE my existing configurations?

It is at this point she says the new version (9 something) might not destroy my existing configurations. Why? She thinks the manual uninstall of 8.82.151 will erase/destroy my existing configuration OR maybe the new version will do it. This would means I would not be able to use my keyboard, headset, or game controller. She is pretty sure the camera will continue to work.

She offers to open a ticket for those above her and I should hear back in 3 day to a week either via email or a phone call.

She can't even tell me if the new G-Hub supports my existing devices. I might have to replace all my Logitech devices with new hardware (forced obsolescence), it seems to me.

Thing is the F710 and F310 are the only game controller Logitech is selling. (I use the controller for several games, including Final Fantasy XI and Alpha Prison (on Steam).) I use the headset with Discord, games, etc. I have configured the keyboard for lots of various stuff. Why shouldn't Logitech provide a migration path for people with older Logitech gear?

I don't have an end to this story / issue / review, yet. All I know is this mouse - right now - doesn't do anything more than a simple ball mouse. I can't enable the higher DPI support or any button. Finally, I still don't understand drawings 3 and 4 or know what I'm suppose to do with the 6 sided thing.

Bottom line: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

***> The printed documentation doesn't make sense and doesn't have an URL for the product (you just go to the default support page for all products).
***> There seems to be serious lack of support for your past purchases with Logitech's G-Hub.
***> Why can't Logitech developers uninstall past versions and insure you don't lose your existing configuration?

I will update this review should Logitech get back to me. I'll gladly let you know how it goes.

UPDATE 1: I have yet to hear back from Logitech support on my software issues. The mouse is running in default mode. I have seen two hardware issues.

1) I changed out my Logitech G105 keyboard for a Dell KB522, which has an internal 2 port USB 2.0 hub. I booted my Dell T7910 and went into the BIOS (where my Razer mouse failed), but this Logitech mouse worked great! It moved and the G was lit.

The problems with the Logitech mouse started after the system booted to Windows 10 and presented the login screen. The G on the mouse never lit and the cursor never appeared on the screen. Only after I plugged in my Dell Optical mouse (with the tracking problem) did the cursor appear on the Windows login screen.

I did get the mouse to appear by plugging it into my Amazon Basic 7 port USB 2.0 hub. Maybe it is a power issue, but Logitech doesn't say the mouse has unusual power requirements.

2) The wheel is overly sensitive for scrolling on webpages and other programs. I'm hoping I can adjust this through the software (whenever Logitech can get back to me with a solution).

Again the bottom line hasn't changed: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

Final update: Logitech got back to me with all the answers on day 35! I thought about returning it to Amazon on day 30, but realized I couldn't get to UPS before the UPS store closed.

Logitech got the mouse working but the G105 keyboard stopped working. Several days later and I'm told the new GHub no longer supports the G105. The answer is yet another piece of software to run.

Why can't Logitech create a single interface for all their software / products (old and current)? Aren't customers returning worth it?"
"Great mouse, awesome customization from color to DPI settings. I love being able to set 3 DPI settings up for those times when I'm gaming and need to really whip around. I have 2 of them, one for work and one for home. In the office it's a bit overkill but when you get used to the feel and response of this mouse, others feel inadequate. The scroll wheel is another big plus, looking at a long document or list, just press the free wheel button, give it a flick, and watch it scroll to the end for you. Button position is only an issue when you slam it into your keyboard and change your DPI mid fight. You will get good and changing it back or learn to move your stuff out of the way very quickly."
"Fits comfortable in my hand, love all the buttons that you can set controls to, my only ""complaint"" is the location of the dpi/sensitivity adjuster buttons on the mouse as they are super close to the left click and I find myself fat-fingering the buttons causing me to miss shots sometimes because I bump up my sensitivity by accident but I'm sure not everyone is gonna have that problem it's just what happened to me when I first got this mouse so keep that in mind but I quickly got used to it and am more careful about my finger placement. Other then that, great mouse for the price and I was lucky enough to catch it on sale :)"
"I've been using the Logitech G502 HERO High-Performance Wired Gaming Mouse for years now, and it's hands down the best mouse I've ever owned. So much so that I buy a new one every two or three yearsâ€”not because the old one breaks, but because I like to rotate them between my three computers. The newest always goes to my primary setup, and the older ones keep performing flawlessly on the secondary machines.

What sets this mouse apart is the level of customization it offers. The adjustable weight system is a standout feature for me. Being able to fine-tune the weight to match my preference makes a huge difference during long gaming sessions or extended work hours. It feels tailor-made for my hand every time.

The programmable macros are another highlight. Assigning custom commands to the buttons has streamlined both my gaming and productivity workflows. Whether I'm diving into intense gaming battles or managing complex software tasks, having those macros at my fingertips is incredibly convenient.

The build quality is exceptional. Even after years of heavy use, my older G502 mice are still going strong without any signs of wear or performance issues. The ergonomic design fits comfortably in my hand, and the responsiveness is top-notch.

If you're in the market for a reliable, customizable, and high-performing mouse, I can't recommend the Logitech G502 HERO enough. It's been a consistent and invaluable part of my setup for years, and I don't see that changing anytime soon."
"There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!

1) Daily use
Not everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros:
- Fits incredibly well around your hand
- Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use
> Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc.
- Great grip
- Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software

2) Gaming
When I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros:
- You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better!
- The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something)
- The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.

Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!

*** Update ***
The mouse is durable and has stood the test of time very well! The software setting up the mouse bindings has changed, so I am still getting used to that. Works very well in gaming, and enjoy the ability to transition from work 1,000 dpi and copy/paste, cut, etc., as bindings to gaming with 650 dpi jump, melee, etc.. Definitely good fit for someone with a big palm like myself."
"The G502 lives up to the hype! The HERO sensor is incredibly accurate and responsive, even at the absurdly high 16,000 DPI (though I rarely use it that high). The customizable buttons are incredibly useful, allowing me to streamline actions in games and even automate repetitive tasks at work. I can now copy and paste with just two button presses, a massive time-saver. The adjustable weights let me fine-tune the feel in my hand. This is a premium mouse that's built to last, and I highly recommend it to any serious gamer or anyone who wants to increase their productivity."
