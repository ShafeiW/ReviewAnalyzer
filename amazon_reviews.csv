Review
"This keyboard has specific sensors for actuation, etc. so you can't really change the sound. The keyboard does sound fine as it is. Excellent quality on the screen and great lighting and colors. I wish you could upload the presets to the keyboard so it always did the same thing instead of needing to connect to the app on startup. Sometimes the keyboard will revert back to default and that sucks. This is a wired keyboard but that doesn't matter to me. Full size because I need the 10 key."
"When a rogue Win 10 update took out my Gskill KM780 RGB unexpectedly, I had to pull the trigger fast on a new KB instead of having to endure using my spare membrane board. After a solid day of research, I took a chance on the Apex Pro.

Coming from Cherry MX Browns, I had some reservations about OmniPoint. The Browns have a tactile point which I liked. I had tried MX Reds, and wasn't a fan of the linear feel. With these Omni switches being linear, I was unsure but somehow compelled to pass on the Apex 7 with MX Browns and go Pro. TBH, I was half expecting to return it. Needless to say.... I was surprised when I hooked this up!

First off... dat switch. Wow. SUPER smooth. The inherent scratchiness of linear MX switches is GONE. It feels like the keycaps are just sort of floating over the brushed aluminum base. The adjustment ability is unique compared to most mechanical boards, bringing a true Hall Effect switch to people. (Look up Hall Effect... gets a little complex for explanation here, but very cool) Actuation can be adjusted from a light brush on the keys (probably overkill) to making the switch bottom out completely. This can also be done on a per key basis. Lot of range to play with!

Another key strength... the RGB lighting. Its nothing short of fantastic. The raised caps let the bright and vibrant lighting spill over the board itself, creating a very cool and clean lighting effect. Even for those who don't much care about RGB lighting, it's very tastefully done here.

Typing is unreal. I spent 15 mins just typing random weirdness on a word doc just for them feels when I first hooked it up. And for some reason, I find myself with a lot less errors compared to old board with the Browns. I'd commonly get keypress duplication (as if I held the key down) with that switch, and with these Omni switches, it doesn't happen anymore. Of course, these Omni switches are much quieter than the tactile Browns given their linear nature.

Not much bad to say here. Some minor gripes would be somewhat ""meh"" software from Steelseries and the keycaps being ABS instead of something like double-shot PBT caps. The latter feel much sturdier and more premium, and I suppose one could buy some PBT caps if it was a huge issue. Not sure how that would affect the lighting though. The small B&W OLED screen in the upper right doesn't add much in reality, but its kind of a geeky fun thing that you can customize with whatever you want. It does have some functionality with brightness and other features, which is nice to have versus having to use the software. Also, only the primary keys have Omni switches. All the F keys, num pad, and extra function keys are on a generic linear switch that feels good enough. Would be nice to have all keys on omni switches, but it makes sense from a cost perspective and isn't a big deal to me.

All in all, fantastic keyboard that towers over my old Gskill in every respect. I really wish MS terrible updates hadn't bricked old board, but I guess things happen for a reason. If you have the cash and want a great analog-based mechanical keyboard with adjustable hall effect switches.... this is the one for you. Very hard to fault this board. Steelseries done good here."
"I upgraded from my Logitech G915 to this. I am going to say, for me, this was a smart move. This keyboard offers so many functions compared to the G915. I am a gamer, and still am trying to figure out how to use the new things this ketboard has to offer for my gamine (outside of using it to cheat in fps games). I am inpressed with the lighting. My old keyboard had lighting as well, but it was weak. This is much more vibrate and has punch. As well, my old keyboard did not light up secondary key functions. This does. The keyboard lay out fits my hands. The G915 'low profile' just sucked. They didn't offer a wirst rest. This keyboard comes with one. As well I notice with this keyboard, I don't have as many typos like I use to. The keys are pronouced and easy to find without looking at the keyboard. I like the little LED screen in the conrer as well. I have seen people post about it saying it was worthless. Well I can tell you, you can make your own apps for it to your hearts dirsire. Issues: The Steel series program does have issues. Sometimes the lighting shuts off, then right back on. I have notice that the company is pushing out patches and updates. And the issue in not a deal breaker. While this does come with a very nice wrist rest, animal hair tends to stick to it. I have had to but a lint remover and keep it down stairs with the keyboard. Everytime I pet my cats somehow their hairs sticks to the rest and is a pure pain to get off trying to to it by hand. All in all, it's a expensive keyboard, but this is a case of you ARE getting what you paid for. And Steel Series is doing to Logitech what AMD is doing to Intel: They are making far superior products as far as mouse/keyboard/headset items."
"THIS KEYBOARD IS AMAZING! This has as 0.1 actuation feature built into it if you download the SteelSeries app on your PC. This feature is FABULOUS if you are playing in a fast fps shooter game where you have to react fast like Valorant or CS2. Or if you are playing a game that just needs fast reaction time and alot of key pressing like the game, Fortnite, its AMAZING for that too. The 0.1 actuation key switch feature lets you barley touch the key and its already responsive. Its like letting the keyboard read your mind. And if there is a game where you have to let go and press the button really fast like the game OSU, this keyboard has you covered with their amazing rapid trigger feature that they have on their app. I personally loved it and I am sure you will too. This is the best keyboard I have ever owned and might not to replace or get another one soon. It is also really great for the price you have to pay."
"So far the keyboard has been everything I have wanted… almost. Great feel to typing, adjustable actuation(although NOT on all keys). The keycaps have a great feel to them and the lighting is excellent.

However, the included wrist rest is IMO terrible. It is a rock hard piece of plastic with a matte finish. It is not comfortable at all. I came over from a full size Razer Huntsman V2 keyboard(wanted a TKL keyboard) that had a very nice PADDED wrist rest included and felt very good when typing. They NEED to do that here. I ended up ordering a RAZER TKL padded wrist rest and am using that in place of the included wrist rest.

Second is the fact that not all keys are adjustable. Only the letters/numbers are. The outer keys like F keys, arrows and such are simply RED switches. This leads to an inconsistent feel between keys. IMO this is a CHEAP way of doing this and for this price, should NOT be the case. On Razer keyboards, every key is adjustable as they are all the same switches.

Their software is ok. It does lack a few features in the lighting area that Razer has. One in particular is with Razer, you could set the angle of movement on things like color shift, so instead of being only horizontal/vertical, you could angle it to look like it’s coming from say the upper left to bottom right. Can’t do that here without doing a major individual key lighting set up. Overall the software is ok but could use additional features.

The reason I chose this over the Razer was, I really like the sound/feel of typing much more than the Razer and I use this for work and play.

Pros
Great feel to typing
Key caps feel great
Adjustable actuation(on many keys, not all)
Great lighting

Meh
Software. It’s ok but need more lighting adjustments.

Cons
Not all keys are adjustable. This is a fail and a cheap way of doing it.
TERRIBLE wrist rest

I love the typing on this so I am keeping it, but if SteelSeries reads this, STOP being cheap and make ALL keys adjustable. No reason at all to put red switches on the outer keys. Games these days, involve a lot more keys than just the letters/numbers and get a better wrist rest, padded! Also work on your software and offer more lighting adjustments."
"I bought this keyboard for both working and gaming. For work, I really like the feeling when I am typing. It feels very easy and does not cause too much discomfort/fatigue after several hours since the keys are spaced perfectly for my hands and are sensitive enough that I don't need to put a lot of pressure. For gaming, I really like the latency and responsiveness. I also appreciate the wheel on the top right-hand corner for volume control/muting. Additionally, the customizable color theme is a big plus for me as well and matches the aesthetic of my office. Definitely recommend!"
"This keyboard isn't worth a third the price you pay for it. I'd have given this an extra star if I hadn't paid a premium for it; the cost in conjunction with how it just barely checks the boxes on its basic feature descriptions drops my rating to rock bottom.
1. The keys are SO sensitive you'll be swearing that if you break wind in their general direction you're going to get five random keystrokes. It's ridiculous. You'd love to think that setting the key actuation point to the very bottom would let you work around this, but no; the actuation point goes nowhere near where the key bottoms out (other gripes on actuation settings below). Every single time you start typing at a comfortable pace you'll be bumping the sides of keys accidentally, and every time you get in a scramble in whatever game you're playing you're going to get extra inputs. From what I can tell, you can't replace the switches to something with a tactile feel or a heavier weight, even from the SteelSeries website (for other keyboards they sell: YES, the parts are there; for THIS model (Apex Pro): NO, there's nothing, at least as of the time of this review).
2. In general, actuation settings have issues:
a. You cannot apply actuation settings on anything to the right of the ENTER key or the Steel Series meta key itself or the Function keys. I don't know why I paid extra for a full keyboard over a third of the keys aren't fully functional.
b. Dual actuation doesn't seem consistent or especially useful. I tried to find purposes for it but in my experience it's absolutely worthless. It also isn't available for the whole keyboard.
c. It's also really easy to accidentally screw up all your custom actuation settings because by default it has all keys selected when you go into that part of the engine configuration, which is counter-intuitive because you might have come there while working on a specific key from the bindings or illumination tabs. For the same reasons, just don't EVER mess with actuation settings from the keyboard's built-in adjustments, especially if you have custom actuation settings on different keys, because you'll lose everything.
d. The ""rapid trigger"" configuration fails to impress. Sometimes I think I can feel it working but I still miss fast double-taps frequently enough. This also doesn't work at all until after you apply a firmware update to the keyboard (at least as of when I bought this late in 2023)
e. Setting a key's actuation value to 4.0 (represented as the bottom of the stroke visually in the settings) is still significantly high in the keypress.
3. You can't cycle backward through on-board profiles, and cycling is slow and clunky. You also can't assign hotkeys for accessing specific profiles on the fly. This is especially annoying when you have custom keybindings, so moving from a game to respond to someone in chat is really slow and clunky.
4. Macro keybindings don't work as you expect, unless they're brainlessly simple like Shift plus some other key. Not what I expected and not what I paid for.
6. All the default illumination settings are childishly distracting novelties and completely unusable by anyone trying to focus on anything whatsoever. Be prepared for a trippy flashbang every time you cycle from profile #2 back to your profile #1 until you manually override all 5 illumination profiles on the keyboard.
7. You must have 5 and exactly 5 profiles loaded at all times. You can't have less or more than that. You can store additional profiles in the engine config, but there's no officially supported way to back up or externally edit any of your profiles.
8. You can't get to your Apex Pro engine configuration directly. You need to open this other app called ""SteelSeries GG"" first. The ""SteelSeries GG"" is also problematic because occasionally it will notify you that it needs an update but the notification vanishes extremely fast and you then need to find the update under Settings->About.
9. The whole physical design of the keyboard:
a. Why of all places would you put the keyboard's meta button for special functions and changing modes in the place of a commonly-used key? Why not put it in its own spot? Heck, why not put it in place of SCROLL LOCK which hasn't served any purpose whatsoever since 1985? Yes, you can re-assign it, but the key looks wrong and you have to do it for each profile. Just bad design.
b. The keycaps themselves. Some edgelord at SteelSeries decided to be cool and invert the shift-modified character of each key with its unmodified counterpart, so for instance "":"" appears BELOW "";"" and ""?"" appears BELOW ""/"". This is just a visual thing and it won't bother too many people who already know how to type but it's just another wacky design choice that makes no sense.
c. The cord for this keyboard is just COMICALLY stiff and thick. There's absolutely no justification for this, except maybe to keep it from getting stuck under your corner keys such as CTRL. If you occasionally have to rearrange your desk, such as for things like cleaning, or maybe swapping from your work setup to your free-time setup (this is my case) expect to have this cord fighting you every step of the way.
d. Be prepared to have normal-width cords such as your mouse and headphones get stuck under the keys on the edge (looking at you, CTRL). There's nothing mechanically preventing this from happening. You'll regret this every time you find your CTRL key not actuating when you press it because you have a charging cable under it, or you drag your Apex Pro off your desk because your headphone cord was wrapped up in the top row of keys. Just make sure everything else on your desk is wireless and you'll be fine, I guess?
e. The scroll wheel and special illuminated button on the top right of the keyboard. Seriously, I did NOT need another place to control my volume and play/pause videos. You CAN use this to adjust illumination and other settings but it's slow to start up and not especially friendly and it has potential to screw up your per-key custom settings. This behavior should have been customizable; in fact I dare say the scroll wheel should have been where you cycle up and down through profiles, and that button should have been the meta key.
10. On a few occasions my profiles have become corrupt and/or de-synchronized from the engine config view while saving and editing. This is hard to reproduce but it sucks when you put a lot of work into sensitivity and custom bindings and illumination for a specific setup.

Pros:
It's a keyboard. Custom bindings work. It hasn't broken yet. Feels solid. For a full-sized keyboard it's space-efficient even though the cord is obnoxious.

In conclusion, I think many of these problems could be alleviated by better firmware and engine config features, but not everything. The only special feature I really needed, the custom keybindings, is working, and I'm happy that the keyboard feels like it's unlikely to break anytime soon, but everything else is a disappointment. I should have returned this thing but it didn't feel right with the effort I put into setting it up and with my fingerprints all over it.
Any remaining uncorrected typographical errors present in this review, I'm blaming the random stray keystrokes.

UPDATE 2024-06-23:
I WISH it was possible to give this product ZERO stars. It reset my actuation settings in today, at some random time after my tournament started. This isn't even the first time this happened but the timing couldn't have been worse. I tried to file a support ticket on the steelseries support site and while it said at some point I submitted a ticket successfully I've yet to get a confirmation email and I'm just endlessly going back and forth with their chatbot, which by the way is completely useless. If you intend to buy this keyboard for advanced use and competitive play I strongly advise against it, and if you do anyway, I actually feel sorry for you."
"I would struggle to play games if I had to go back to another keyboard after using this one. Even mechanical keyboards just are not as good. Being able to change my push detected distance AND my release detect distance on every single key independently of each other is amazing. Abilities I need to activate on the slightest twitch can be set that way. Other keys can have much greater push distances to prevent accidentally activating an ability on a partial push. I see why the professional use this keyboard. Do note, unless you create a typing push distance profile, this keyboard is kind of annoying for long typing sessions with my gaming settings. It also lacks the numpad and things like print screen buttons. They can be added to other keys like the f keys, but they are not on here by default. The keys can be removed easily if you have other key caps you like. It is easy to clean. It feels well made and sturdy. Like all previous mechanical keyboards I have had, it is a little loud. The keys are snappy and responsive, and you can set at what push distance they trigger. I cannot say enough good things about the keyboard for improved gaming performance."
"UPDATE: I still really like this keyboard, but I was starting to notice that I actually type really inaccurately on it - it does get annoying. I just make a lot of mistakes, and I've been typing for 40 years and normally type about 100wpm. I was trying to figure out why this is, and lately I've had my old IBM Model M in the room hooked up to another computer and have felt the obvious difference in accuracy. (The Model M is where the modern keyboard layout comes from.) I still just type much better on the Model M. So I directly compared the two keyboards to figure out what the difference is.

Obviously the Model M is bigger overall, but my big realization is that the actual key layout on the Model M is slightly wider. It's not just a difference in the ""dead space"" in between keyboard sections, either - there is actually slightly less space between each key on the Steelseries keyboard. I've compared all the keyboards I've owned against the Model M and while some have had minor layout variations and most these days have the function keys much closer to the main keys, this is the first time I've seen keys that were actually closer together. I'm sure it's not the only keyboard like that, but it's the only one I've owned that is and it explains my typing inaccuracy on it. I've taken a star off my original review for that reason. It is just not a full size keyboard, even though it looks like it is. It feels cramped, and I've never gotten fully adjusted to it.

My original review is below:
----------------------------------------
For the price, it had better be good. And it is. My score is 5 stars but consider it more like 4 1/2 rounded up. A bit closer to 5 than 4; not perfect but nearly so. I'll explain.

I'm both a typist and a gamer, but these days probably more of the former than the latter. Still, I try to find keyboards good for both purposes, and many are - heck, the old IBM Model M is still a great gaming keyboard if you don't need n-key rollover (and to be honest, most people really don't). But my old Motospeed keyboard, which I loved for its feel and its small footprint (as small as it gets for a full size keyboard) seemed to just wear out - it started repeating keypresses constantly, so I decided I'd just go for something new rather than try to fix it. (But I probably will fix it at some point; it's a great keyboard too.)

This is the first linear keyboard I've owned in many years. I usually prefer clicky keyboards and have since the days of the original IBM PC and the Model F. But I just wanted something different after owning clicky keyboards for so long, and my Motospeed was *really* clicky to the point that it did become a little grating after a few years. I'd read about the wonders of the OmniPoint keyswitches in the Apex Pro and I watched the excellent Chyrosran22 review of it on YouTube (search for that; he knows keyboards and he loves this one). I did also manage to try one out for a brief few minutes, though not long enough to really form my own opinion. But in the absence of any more obvious choice, I took the plunge and bought one.

Bottom line: It is a really well built keyboard (almost zero flex) that feels *almost* as good to type on as any linear keyboard I've ever used in about 40 years of computing. It has double-shot keycaps so the legends won't wear out, it's got a really useful volume roller, and it's got a little screen that can be used for various things, most of which are kinda dumb but I do use it for displaying current system stats - there is an app to display CPU, GPU and RAM usage. Its backlighting is pretty bright, fully RGB and has some effects that are actually kinda useful - I'm not sure what the effect I use is called, but it just lights the key you press up in white for a half-second or so before smoothly fading it back to whatever color the rest of the keyboard is backlit in. It's actually helpful to have a little split-second feedback showing which key you just typed, just in case you make a mistake.

The OnmiPoint keyswitches do feel great - very smooth - and they're user-adjustable in terms of the actuation point. This is unique to this type of keyswitch, which is an uncommon magnetic sensor type of mechanical switch. I will say that I *feel* more accurate on this keyboard than my old Motospeed - I think the design and spacing of the keycaps on this keyboard is maybe a little more standard.

So, that's that - now I'm going to tell you about the *little* things that keep it from being perfect. Keep in mind that absolutely none of these are dealbreakers, or things other people might even necessarily think of as drawbacks. But...

The cord is non-detachable and it's quite stiff. It's also just rubber insulated, which is fine, but kinda ugly on such an expensive keyboard. The keyboard has two USB plugs, one for the USB port on the keyboard itself (it won't act as a hub, just a pass-through), and that USB plug is on the left side of the keyboard. That means if you want the keyboard cable on the right, which the cable management on the back of the keyboard lets you do, your mouse cable will still be on the left. I feel like this is an odd design given that most people are right-handed. A choice would be best, but if you're going to pick a place for one USB port, put it on the right.

Only the ""main"" keys are OmniPoint - that's everything in the little ""typewriter"" cluster, that main rectangle of letters and numbers that you type the most on. The others are either Cherry MX Red or some kind of copy of them. To be honest, I'm not sure which switch I prefer! I know which I'm ""supposed"" to prefer but the regular Reds on the rest of the keyboard seem to have a very slightly lighter weighting. Probably my only semi-serious complaint about the keyboard in general - and this is 100% subjective, so it's not a top-line item for this review - is that the OmniPoint switches are just a *tiny* bit heavier than I like, and probably as a consequence of that feel very, very slightly ""mushy"" as you reach full travel. The switches on the rest of the board, while very slightly ""grittier"", are also a tiny bit lighter and do not feel mushy. All that said, I will allow that someone else could feel entirely the opposite. This is personal preference, and anyway it's not a big difference. But there *is* a difference in the switches on different parts of the board, and it does sometimes feel a little odd as a result.

After only several *days* of use, the soft-touch finish is already wearing off several of the keys. Now, you can see by this review that I type a *lot*. So it may take longer for you, and anyway the legends themselves will never wear off since they're doubleshot. But my space bar is already looking a little ugly with one part of it already noticeably shiny. I never understand this - my Model F and Model M that are 30+ years old still look brand new, while a keyboard that's only days old (and cost a couple hundred bucks) already has a finish that's wearing off.

Overall, though, I think I'll be happy with this keyboard until I get tired of linear keys and want to go back to clicky. But who knows when or if that'll happen. At the moment, I'm pleased with my purchase, even for the money. This thing does feel like an expensive keyboard."
"The Steelseries Apex Pro is a superb keyboard. (Apology for the superlative!). It has been my favorite for the 10 days during which I tried seven other brands of keyboards.

The typing was my easiest and best with this. I found out how much the keyboard wrist pad is useful.
This, and other brands, I tried are for committed gamers. I have never played a single game, so you might wonder why I want it.

This keyboard is more rugged, more resistant to passionate keyboard pounding during games. This can, and I believe, it does give it extra durability. Of course, durability and feature come with a price, but I have never regretted the keyboard design and manufacturing on that account.

I do not want to paraphrase the features which are more than plenty in the ads. I like them all. The keyboard lighting is exceptional compared to others I have tested.

My case has to do with guide and instruction the manufacturer publishes with the product. I must say the worst I had been exposed to was Logitech, even though I owned their products for several decades. In their case, it is a flimsy 2-page paper, where essential Logitech write-up shares its space with 9-10 other languages.

My primary use of any keyboard is office type. My primary interest in the high-end gaming keyboards is the ability to create and use macros. Those macros can be used in non-gaming software, such as MS Office, Adobe, Movavi, and just about anything else.

That was the place where my problem started. Inadequate documentation is common. Manufacturers count on the internet users to provide instructions for any aspect of the advertised features. If you cannot find what you are looking for you are ready for time consuming guesses.

Actually, Steelseries Apex Pro is amongst the better ones. Unfortunately, there are those of us users, who had to be spoon fed the instructions despite decades of computer experience.
I give Steelseries five stars, even though my initial bad guesses with the keyboard necessitated a return. But guess, the replacement is none other than Steelseries."
"It sounds and feels really good and it makes a noticeable difference in my games. I really like the OLED display as well, and it is fully customizable. My one complaint is that the wrist wrest magnet fell off in like 2 days. It's easily fixable with some super glue, but if I'm paying $150 for a keyboard, I want to build quality to be slightly better."
If you set the actuation on high you will find out how often you rest your fingers on the keyboard without intending to. I’ve accidentally jumped of many roofs in COD now.
"Very good, but I wish it was more affordable or had ALL buttons with Omnipoint 3.0 switches to justify the price.

Other than that, they somehow moved the RGB bulbs into the inner part of the switches. This makes the overall RGB lighting noticeably dimmer compared to Gen 1 / Gen 2 keyboards. The older versions had the bulbs on the outer part allowing the colors to beatifully pop out."
"Seriously, it's my new favorite keyboard. I have tried numerous of the big brands and small brands. This one just does it for me. The sounds of the keys are not overwhelming while still feeling nice to press.

The wrist rest is easily removed for cleaning. It's magnetic, with no clips, so there is no chance of you damaging it trying to remove it and put it back on again. I haven't had to remove the keys for cleaning, yet. They are raised enough from the board that some compressed air is efficient enough. SteelSeries software is pretty nice and allows you to customize your macros easily. My favorite feature is adding a small GIF to the OLED screen on the keyboard."
"I’ve had this keyboard since march 2024. I love the keyboard, it sounds amazing , gives me great gameplay.. but at the 8 month mark or so it’s had a key go bad. I’m not sure why it won’t go to the color I have it set as. It only goes green and red (key number 9) I uploaded a picture for proof as I have the key color as pink/ purple and rest red but only shows as a red key."
"This is an amazing keyboard! You can make the keycaps whatever color you want by clicking steel series key and f9. It weighs 2.4 pounds and its dimensions are 11.5 x 4 x 1.6 inches.

It has rapid triggers, 1000 hz polling rate, and 0.7 ms latency (reported by steel series.) it has Omni point switches which are extremely fast, you can adjust the actuation as low as 0.1 mm or as high as 4.0 mm. Another one of my favorite parts about it is the height-adjustable tilt legs."
"Overall pretty happy with the quality and ability to adjust actuation, but... why only allow adjustment of 2/3 of the keys? Number keys matter too. Also would love some more options for what displays on the little screen. Seems like there should be since I have to install yet ANOTHER app on my computer to use this keyboard."
"If you are like me and looking at this board, you may be getting frustrated at how hard it is to find that nearly perfect board that should exist, when you're willing to drop over $230.

Pros:
- Omnipoint switches work as advertised -- if you like super fast response time, you can't beat these. These switches also have excellent bounce and no ping.
- PBT keycaps are nice, and switch cross-stems are compatible with a lot of after-market keycaps. Overall a solid thock.
- Unlike other small wireless boards (ahem Logitech G915 TKL...), this has no rattle
- Very light and quite compact even among TKLs, makes for a good portable board in a TKL case.
- The volume wheel is very satisfying.

Cons:
- Firmware issues, firmware issues all around. There are some updates available, but even with it, the battery indicator is botched. My first piece would refuse to charge (as far as I could tell) until it was nearly drained. The second unit charged, but the battery indicator would be all over the place based on what was going on, ranging from 30% to 80% within a 4 minute span! Which is accurate? Who knows.
- Also, the battery life kinda sucks. Typically lost over 50% charge with moderate LED lighting in 5-6 hours of use with an aggressive sleep timer set. Other boards lose barely 15% with this amount of usage.
- The keyboard doesn't wake up very fast, and it doesn't register the keypress you used to wake it up. Leads to missed keystrokes often, especially if you set a low sleep timeout to conserve battery.
- The only Caps lock indicator is the LED color of the key becomes white (which tbh is kinda blue, see below) when active. This is really hard to see quickly, and there is no option to use the superfluous OLED screen for this. Overall the OLED screen would have been better used for lock or battery indicator lights. This is kind of a big QoL issue for me that could be easily resolved with OLED firmware.
- LEDs are kinda off. Blues are too strong, reds very weak, and have heard of folks having issues with LEDs dying, with no easy repairability.
- Despite how nice the switches are, they don't feel as good as gasket-mounted/dampened switches. The spacebar is a huge offender, with no stabilizers it is jarringly louder than every other key, but is one pressed quite often so it makes you sound like a really bad drummer. It's hard to not compare this board to others at this price point that sound way better (see: ROG Azoth).
- The USB-C 2.4Ghz transmitter is quite chonky as far as transmitters go these days (again, see ROG Azoth). This makes it project a good bit from your computer, making for a prime cable-snagger. On top of that you likely need a USB-A adapter or extension cable, which is one more component that is a failure point, takes up space and hampers portability. There's also no dock in the keyboard for them (which they could have easily accommodated) for portability.

The cons list outnumbers the pros by just a little bit much for a $200+ keyboard, hence why I returned it. Ultimately the ASUS ROG Azoth was the first and only $200+ board to check the features I wanted while having fewer cons than pros. Still, the Apex Pro TKL is a clear second, with some advantages that might tip the scales in its favor if those are more important to you."
He’s absolutely over the moon with this keyboard. He keeps rattling things off that are gibberish to me. I’ve not been aquatinted with the latest jargon🤷🏼‍♂️. But it really makes him happy👍🏽
"If you have a kid who likes to game at a high level, get them this keyboard overall was very good, and my kid loves it!"
"Short and sweet: I write for a living. Unlike other keyboards, this one lacks latency issues. The accuracy of my typing has skyrocketed. Moreover, as someone with arthritis in his hands, the wrist rest is amazing. Because it's magnetized I don't have to worry about it slipping around. My hand pain has plummeted since I used this for office work. And while there are other keyboards that advertise themselves as ergonomic, this one actually reduces my hand pain. Is this pricy? Yes. Do I think it's weird that I use a gaming keyboard for office work? Yeah, in a good way. Would I recommend it to my friends who don't game and have hand issues? I already have. The other features of the keyboard are nice for gaming, but that's not really my bag anymore. And given that I bang away on this thing for 8-14 hours a day for work, I can attest to the fact that it is durable. You'll save money on it in the long run if you buy this and don't run through other keyboards. One of the best purchases I ever made."
"The steelseries apex pro mechanical gaming keyboard is a keyboard I really wanted to love. I have been looking forward to being able to have the best of both worlds with fast linear switches when I'm gaming and need every advantage I can get, and going back to a high quality typing experience when I am living the professional life. Maybe this keyboard will be that for some people, as the switches themselves are subject to the users preference. However I can share my experience and preferences to hopefully guide whether or not this keyboard is good for you.
For starters, I have been using Razer Green switches for the majority of my typing experience over the last 5+ years. I have also enjoyed using some Outemo blue switches on a redragon keyboard I used for a short while and Cherry Browns are my next alternative that I have tested. Cherry reds are good for gaming but I have found them to be to easy to click making typos more frequent when typing at a fast APM or preparing to press a key.
If I had to compare the switches here, the closest I can compare them to are Reds or Razers Omnipoint switches. They were very fast to click, and honestly I just don't enjoy that experience enough to be able to commit a long portion of time to try and learn how to best deal with it. The keyboard also wasn't as silent as other options which felt like a weird trade when the other options were pretty good at being silent alternatives.
Diving a bit further, this keyboards saving grace was supposed to be the adjustable actuation switches to cover all scenarios. However in my short opinion of the device, I couldn't tell much of a difference between the different modes. You can set different macros to have the different actuations be quickly accessible if you do find 2 or more you like if that's your type of thing.
Lastly, the build quality did feel quite well made. There's a simple yet nice magnetic wrest which ended up being something I used as the legs don't adjust the height very much. On the back there's an illuminated USB port you can use, tho I found it to be more noticeable then other keyboards which opted me to not route my mouse through it anymore. The RGB is very bright if that's your thing but after doing a few tests I left it on static red to match my other peripherals.
All in all, a well made keyboard, and if I was opting solely for gaming and was using other steelseries peripherals I would probably love it. However steelseries doesn't have a proper MMO option (please create a proper naga competitor, please), wasn't the biggest fan of the included keycaps, lack of dedicated macro / media keys, the poor height adjustment kind of made this not good enough to replace my current blackwidow. Not to mention the poor placement of the passthrough usb being in a very awkward spot, and no headphone passthrough port (surprisingly useful for me). Great attempt steelseries, hope you keep innovating on the next one despite this not being for me in the end and bet the Blue or Brown switch options would have been more up my alley.
Last note, almost forgot to comment on the OLED panel and it was a little bit of a disappointment that I wiped it from my memory. The tech geek in me was hype to just have a little toy with it however it ended up being way more boring for a multi monitor user. If I had only had a single or dual monitor maybe it could have some value, but I got 3 at the moment so I just couldn't find anything useful to put on it. I'd rather just toss discord on a side screen than look at my keyboard for the messages. Most gifs I tried to put on it didn't come out well either, and while tempted to recreate them for the screen there was no value in doing so. I'll end with I just left a logo I liked on it, and noticed that the backlight made the internal panel way more visible than I imagined through the ""top"" piece of it, and look way less fancy than it appears in the marketing. Leaving me sorely disappointed and bored with the feature, despite how cool it might feel."
"Bought one to replace an aging Corsair K-70 Mk.2 RGB. Comparing the two, the Steelseries has easier to use software (less buggy or resource heavy) and the color range and intensity of the LEDs is greater than on the Corsair. The Corsair software seems to allow you to do a bit more with regards to effects, but I am still learning the ins and outs of the SS app. The cons to this keyboard is the LCD menu has various options (like brightness) buried several levels deep and I miss having a dedicated brightness key that I could just tap. Also, for some odd reason the Enter, Tab and Caps Lock keys are not labeled but rather just use symbols. A very small nit to pic but I would have preferred these were still labeled as on other keyboards. I really like the wrist guard with its slightly pliable rubber coating. the keys are sufficiently clicky without being too loud. As for the adjustable sensitivity setting, seems a bit overhyped. I just left everything at the default and seems to work ok but then I am not trying any competition gaming so YMMV. One last comment is with the scroll wheel. It can be clicked or scrolled but I have found that if you try and rotate it away from the edge, it can seem to *stick* a bit. You have to scroll it from just the top edge and then it scrolls more or less freely, but never as smoothly as the one on the Corsair keyboards."
"El SteelSeries APEX Pro es, sin duda, uno de los teclados mecánicos más impresionantes en el mercado actual. Desde el primer momento, destaca por su construcción robusta y diseño elegante, con un marco de aluminio de calidad aeronáutica que asegura durabilidad y un toque de sofisticación.

La experiencia de escritura es fluida y cómoda, con teclas que ofrecen un feedback táctil agradable sin ser ruidosas. También incluye reposamuñecas magnético para mayor comodidad, algo que se agradece en sesiones prolongadas.

En resumen, el SteelSeries APEX Pro es un teclado que no solo cumple con las expectativas, sino que las supera. Combina tecnología avanzada, personalización sin precedentes y una calidad de construcción superior, haciendo de él una opción excepcional para cualquiera que busque lo mejor en un teclado mecánico."
"Muy muy buen teclado, e derramado líquidos en el accidental mente y ni así se a dañado"
This is my 2 week update on this keyboard and I can say coming from a razer hunt man's mini v1 this keyboard is a huge upgrade without breaking the bank and if you like the tkl but don't want the big keyboard I would highly suggest you pick this one up
Me gusta todo funciona perfecto
"Although I don’t use many of the functions as I’m still learning them, it’s good to know they are there. I’ve had very few problems so far."
Only criticism I have is the magnets on the wrist/forearm rest loses the adhesive property over time and fall out of the socket when you take off the rest at times not needed. They just need to do a better job of securing the magnets to rest socket. I have used this keyboard since 02MAY2024.
The adjustable actuation & rapid trigger work wonders. Great for games like valorant & cs. No longer have to press d to stop it’s that quick.
"Well firstly I'm gonna tell anyone reading this to get it in the Amazon box cause I had to order it twice since the driver stole the first one, which was probably my own fault for trying to save packaging since it gives you the option to not have the extra box since it ships in a box. Amazon did refund though since it was never delivered.

Now onto the keyboard, I was on a Razer Blackwidow before this one. I'm a PC gamer and have a bloodflow problem in my fingertips. The adjustable actuation is what really ended up being why I looked at it so I dont have to worry as much about the keys not pressing unless I hear the key bottom out. Which isn't great for the keyboard life.
The design is clean, it's actually quite light compared to the Blackwidow the usb plugs for the kb and passthrough though are quite short though so I had to do some rearranging. I kind of wish that with this expensive of a keyboard, that the cable was braided and the keys were doubleshot pbt like their newer ones, these dont feel as great to use but I guess they have other keycaps that you can buy that are...

The keys sound and feel more like linear switches rather than clicky or tactile ones. Which isn't an issue to me, but might be for some people. Itll take some getting used to but its fine to me.

The lighting is nice and the keyboard itself looks very clean in printing lighting is less than in the thumbnail photo of it so I added what it actually looks like.

The software (Steelseries GG) isnt the easiest to use tbh to adjust the actuation. It doesnt make a ton of sense and it doesnt have much instruction to it.

It also said that it came with a keycap puller but it didnt."
"Don't get me wrong, it's a nice keyboard. It's a little on the loud side, but not a ""clicky"" loud, more of a ""thocky"" loud. The major downside of this board is Steelseries' software.

The customization options are stellar, to be sure. You can do pretty things with the lights. However, I can't for the life of me get those lighting configs to actually work on the hardware profiles, meaning they take minutes after boot for Steelseries' software to launch and reapply the profile. When I edit hardware configs, even if they're identical to the software ones, there's some kind of fight going on between the board and its software that makes them swap between profiles constantly, making the actual keyboard unusable.

Additionally, the OLED panel on the top corner is a certain gimmick - I was hoping its Tidal integration would at least stand out for me, but the window will refuse to update unless I have Tidal maximized in active view, entirely defeating the purpose of a secondary display for it. I haven't tried other apps, here, but the only one I cared about didn't work.

Lastly, I bought this keyboard as it was mentioned in an article (I've since forgotten where) showcasing Hall effect linear keyboards and their ability to use analog input in some games. This board is certainly capable of it, there's just no way to do it because it's limited, once again, by Steelseries' software. You can even use dynamic actuation per-key, just can't map them to an analog axis.

This board is priced to be the best of the best outside of custom-built enthusiast keyboards, and yet I still can't encounter a feature of the keyboard that actually works out of the box. The actual keyboard is great, and it's a shame that it's so kneecapped by software that just doesn't work."
"It's a nice keyboard. I love the way typing feels and sounds but I'm returning it because it's very narrow and I don't like it. I use the keyboard on my lap and this one just doesn't sit right because it's so narrow. I like it otherwise those so I ordered the same keyboard but in the wider variant. I got the Apex Pro TKL which has the arrow keys, page up/down, home, end, delete and insert. That makes it just wide enough for me. And I love the feature where you can adjust how far you have to push the keys in. This keyboard along with the other Apex Pro keyboards have awesome features. Highly recommended!!"
been using this keyboard for a few years now and it still runs perfectly
"I have been a longtime user of the apex pro TKL keyboards as they are really really wonderful keyboards. however, with my old 2019 model starting to have issues after a few years, i upgraded to the 2023 version. my only real complaint with the keyboard is that the magnets on the wrist rest arent as strong as the magnets from the 2019 version, causing the wrist rest to pull away slightly while gaming which is super distracting. i wanted to get this keyboard to be a fix to that, because 60% keyboards usually have a slightly different shape compared to their full size or TKL counterparts. however, i found that the apex pro mini is literally the exact same thing as an apex pro TKL if you were to cut off the function row, the screen, and the arrow key area with the insert and delete keys and whatnot. what i like about most 60% boards is that they have a slightly different shape so that you dont have to use a wrist rest while using them, and with the shape and height of the apex pro TKL, i feel the strong need to use the wrist rest, as it gives me byfar the best accuracy when typing and gaming. sadly i will be returning the apex pro mini as its just the same thing as my apex pro TKL with less features and no benefit for me personally. however, if you are aware of what the apex pro TKL feels like to use with no wrist rest, and just absolutely NEED a 60% for some reason, go ahead and pick this up, otherwise id strongly recommend the apex pro TKL as its the best keyboard on the market, and the only thing i dislike about the board is the strength of the magnets."
"EDIT:
So I contacted the customer service. They did the basic checks and filed a RMA for me. I was to destroy the keyboard before they can ship me another one. They said to break the USB port and take pictures. Which I did. So they have sent a coupon code for the replacement order. Have to order another keyboard through their website with the coupon code. Shipping is free, but it's ground so going to take a little while for the keyboard to come through.
Overall the customer service experience was good. The things I did not like is the shipping how it's ground and IF I only had 1 keyboard, I would be out of a keyboard until I get that one. Thankfully I have spare.

I changed the rating to 4 stars, because the process was painless, just time consuming. Also because of the shipping.

I love their headsets, so I thought let’s try the keyboard! I bought it Nov. 2023. Now in May 2024 I am getting random key press. To a point where I can’t use the keyboard. No software update, tried factory reset, also recalibration. Nothing worked. Even reinstalled the software.
There is no warranty claim on their website. Have to contact the seller from what it is written.
I have emailed them and will see how the process goes. But as of right now, I just feel like my expensive keyboard is just paper weight.
Loved it when it was working."
Perfect for my grandson's first gaming PC build
"TLDR: If you don't want to deal with pre-ordering the Wooting60HE or just really like Steelseries products, this is a really good 60% option.

Pros:
-Omnipoint switches feel very good
-Adjustable actuation point
-Finally adopted PBT keycaps for longevity
-Good RGB brightness and accuracy
-Pretty good stabs out of the box made better with some lube

Cons:
-The Wooting60HE exists...

Thoughts:
Rant time. Right out of the gate, this would be the perfect 60% keyboard currently, if the Wooting60HE didn't exist. It has hotswap switches, acoustic foam, analog functionality, adjustable actuation point, RAPID TRIGGER (huge for high actuation point users), pre-lubed switches and stabs, and doesn't require its software to be active to function fully. This board isn't bad by any means, it's just that the wooting is just better in my opinion. I saw steelseries' video today comparing their ""response time"" with some weird rigged comparison test where they claim a 10ms advantage over the wooting. Even if that were true, which I don't think is accurate, 10ms isn't enough to justify choosing this over the wooting, unless you just really like Steelseries products, which is fine. But the rapid trigger functionality alone is HUGE for switches with a high actuation. If you don't know what that is, basically at any point during the upward travel (after you've pressed a key), you can press down again, to register another keypress. It basically makes the actuation dynamic letting you keep that high actuation, but not require you to fully release the key to press it again. Anyway, rant/PSA over, back to the Apex.

Despite everything I just said, this is still a really good keyboard. If you liked the Apex Pro/TKL, you'll like this. I've found that magnetic switches are easily the smoothest ones on the market, even without lubing. They just glide, absolutely fantastic.

I would comment on the responsiveness, but honestly, I really can't imagine milliseconds making a huge difference for movement inputs in a shooter. Osu probably if that's your thing, but starting to move in one direction or another a milisecond faster isn't going to change your game in the slightest. A mouse, absolutely, but there's really no keyboard input that needs that level of precision. So try not to get hung up on responsiveness in regards to keyboard claims.

Something definitely worth noting is how magnetic switches and optical switches are basically immune to double presses that eventually happen to regular mechanical switches. You can rest assure that all of your key presses will be very accurate.

Conclusion:
Before you commit to this, I highly recommend looking into the Wooting60HE. If you don't want to deal with pre-ordering, or just really like Steelseries products, this is still a really good keyboard. I love the switches, and am so happy they decided to finally start using PBT keycaps."
While the product is good and does what it needs to do it was shipped to me with no outer shipping box around it. It wasn't marked as a gift and not concerned from that standpoint but left on porch this expensive item clearly picturing exactly what it is could have easily been a target for theft. I lucked out but if this is standard shipping practice others may not be as lucky.
Great keyboard and I feels amazing to play with
"I'll preface this review with my biases for it. I got the keyboard because I'm shifting my computer time into digital art and the keyboard has to play nice with the Wacom tablet I have. So the keyboard needs to be on the same level as the tablet.
This keyboard is replacing a huge Logitech G-910 that has takes up a lot more desk area than this one. The lack of dedicated Macro buttons might be a problem for some people, but honestly, I went from a Logitech G11 (with 18 macro keys) to the G910 and didn't miss the lack of dedicated macro buttons. I doubt I will miss the lack of Macro buttons on this keyboard. Also, the software for the SteelSeries does allow you to map any key to any function or macro. So the Ins->PgDn keys could easily serve as macro keys. Another thing to note is that most online games that I've played ban macros as cheating so they really aren't that necessary.
Another feature of this keyboard I really like is that the palm rest is magnetic. It almost seems like this was designed for my use case. When I'm drawing with my Wacom I just remove the palm rest to make the keyboard nice and compact, and when I'm done with drawing for a while I just put it back.
While most of the media keys (stop/play, forward, Reverse) are gone the volume wheel is still there. This is probably the one feature on the G-910 that I would absolutely miss if I didn't have it on this keyboard. It is smaller though, and it's not a free-running wheel so I think I prefer the one on my old keyboard better.
The keys are raised above the bezel so they're easy to pull out if you're careful. This will make cleaning the keyboard easier. And with the software being able to map anything to anything you'd be able to switch the keyboard to Dvorak if that's your thing.
Now for the things that drop the keyboard from a 5 to a 4 star.
There is no light on the keyboard to tell you that the CAPs Lock, Num Lock or Scroll Lock are turned on. This can be a problem when you're putting in passwords. I haven't found it in the software, but there might be a way to set the illumination on those keys to be different depending on the state it's in.
The keys also seem to be fairly loud to me. It might just be that I started typing on a manual typewriter and I'm more used to pounding on keys a bit more than other people are, but I'm nowhere as heavy on the keyboard as some I've heard. When I'm typing on this keyboard it seems awfully loud to my ears.
I might update this review in the next few months if the keyboard fails for any reason. I just hope it doesn't have the same illumination issue that plagued my G910."
Been using it for years and its still just as good as the day I started using it.
"As a keyboard itself, it’s okay. The typing experience isn’t the best either rapid trigger enabled unless you have really good control. The actuation point is noticeable but not that impactful. The only people who this is really good for is like top tier pros in games, but not just the average person trying. Although I will say the keys sound amazing."
"Some of the LED lights have died, and the keys on the keyboard seem like they wore out faster than my old Microsoft keyboard. I love the feel, and the customizable nature of it. It’s just a tad expensive for something that doesn’t seem quite as durable as I thought it would be."
This may be the best keyboard on the market today. I have always bought keyboards in the $100-$200 range and feel this is the best keyboard I've ever owned.
"The SteelSeries Apex Pro Mini Wireless Mechanical Gaming Keyboard is a compact powerhouse that offers great convenience and reliable performance for gamers on the go. As someone who frequently travels and attends gaming events, I was specifically looking for a keyboard that could fit easily in my backpack without sacrificing functionality. The Apex Pro Mini checks that box perfectly.

The compact architecture of this keyboard is truly impressive. Its smaller size allows for effortless portability, making it a breeze to carry around. Whether I'm heading to a gaming tournament or simply going to a friend's house for a LAN party, I can rely on this keyboard to accompany me without adding excessive bulk to my bag. It's a game-changer for those who value mobility and space efficiency.

Another standout feature of the Apex Pro Mini is its long battery life. This keyboard has proven to be a reliable companion during extended gaming sessions. I appreciate not having to constantly worry about charging it, as it lasts for an impressively long time on a single charge. The battery life is certainly a great asset, ensuring uninterrupted gaming experiences without the hassle of frequent recharging.

While the Apex Pro Mini is marketed as a mechanical gaming keyboard, I must admit that it doesn't quite deliver the satisfying tactile feedback and auditory experience that true mechanical keyboards are known for. The key switches, although responsive and precise, lack the distinctive clicky sound and the tactile sensation that enthusiasts of mechanical keyboards cherish. This omission can be disappointing for those who prioritize the authentic mechanical keyboard experience.

Despite this minor drawback, the SteelSeries Apex Pro Mini Wireless Mechanical Gaming Keyboard is still a commendable choice for gamers who value portability and functionality. Its compact design makes it an ideal travel companion, and its long-lasting battery ensures uninterrupted gameplay. If you can overlook the absence of the traditional mechanical keyboard sound, you'll find a reliable and high-performing keyboard in the Apex Pro Mini.

Disclaimer: Please note that this review is based on my personal experience and preferences. The perception of sound and tactile feedback may vary among individuals, and it's recommended to test the keyboard in person if the mechanical keyboard feel is of utmost importance to you."
This keyboard was worth the money works well I love the 0.1 actuation very responsive looks great
"The design was perfect size for gaming, the speed for was efficient for gaming. The colors was vibrant and great for a gaming room"
"I don't know much about it, but my kid wanted it and he is satisfied"
My son liked the product.
